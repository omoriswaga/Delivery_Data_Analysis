=========Current State and Fidings===================
There are two different carrier used by the company in delivery product. These 
different carrier has different status update, for example carrier 2 has "success" and 
carrier 1 has "arrived_at_destination" which is essentially the same but in different
words. 
The average transit time (from when the product has been given a tracker id to when the 
product was delivered successfully) is lesser for carrier 2 than for carrier 1
for each country. Which means carrier 2 has a faster delivery time than carrier 1.
Also, deliverability per day is much higher 
Although, delivery failures are much more in carrier 2 than in carrier 1. Country(SG) 
with the highest number of successful delivery has more carrier 2 compared to carrier 1.

======Deficiencies & Areas of Improvement==============
The countries with the largest amount of goods to deliver are countries with the 
low transit times. Countries with least amount of goods to deliver 
are countries with the high transit times.
An improvement woiuld be adding more carrier 2 to countries using just carrier 1.
And also, carrier 2 should be more than carrier 1 to archieve low average delivery time.
